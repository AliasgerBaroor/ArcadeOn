Given your comprehensive gaming app setup and the current reward page that shows only the **daily streak**, you can make the rewards section far more engaging, loyalty-driving, and aspirational. Here are advanced ideas for what more to show and highlight, all tailored to your existing Arcade On technical and UX structure:

***

**1. Upcoming/Unlocked Rewards**  
Show a **catalog grid** of rewards the user can unlock next based on their existing points and streak, using bright visuals (skins, emotes, badges, gift cards) to tempt engagement.

**2. Tier Progression**  
Display the user's current **Tier** (Bronze/Silver/Gold/etc.) with a clear **progress bar** showing how close they are to the next tier and what new benefits will unlock — link directly to premium reward categories.

**3. Achievement & Badge Showcase**  
Give space to **unlockable/earned achievements**:  
- Recently unlocked achievements (with big flashy icons or animation)  
- Preview of “Next Closest Unlock” achievements with criteria hints (create FOMO and goals)

**4. Redemption History & Status**  
Let the user see rewards they’ve claimed, whether pending (e.g., for real-world items or gift cards) or completed, so every redemption feels valuable and tracked.

**5. Exclusive Offers or Limited-Time Rewards**  
Highlight **weekly challenges**, **event-limited rewards**, or **streak bonuses**—e.g. “Earn 3 more wins this week for a secret skin” or “Holiday Festival Badge – Only for top 100 this week!”

**6. Points Earning Opportunities**  
List new ways the user can earn points quickly—either by participating in daily challenges, inviting friends for referral bonuses, or joining guild/team play for group rewards.

**7. Social Leaderboard Status**  
Show the user’s position on the **leaderboard**, how close they are to reaching “Top X Streak,” and offer direct “Share streak/badge” buttons for bragging to friends.

**8. Reward Redemption Quick Actions**  
Elevate UX with direct “Redeem Now” buttons, swipe-to-redeem actions for popular categories, or pin favorite rewards so users can track them from the leaderboard/profile.

**9. Reward Preview (Animations)**  
For virtual goods, let users preview skins/emotes with mini-animations or try-on features before buying with points.

**10. Charitable/Real-World Redemption**  
Offer conversion of points to charity donations or real-world items—show impact meters, “Recent Donators,” and encourage social sharing for these acts.

**UI/UX Approach:**  
- Use **cards** and **carousel sliders** for dynamic, visually-rich browsing.
- Leverage blur overlays and gold/premium highlights for exclusive tiers.
- Show **progress bars, badges, and unlocked reward icons** with animations.

**Technical Integration:**  
- Pull reward data from your `/api/rewards` endpoint, filtered by user eligibility/tier.
- Use existing PointsTransaction and Redemption models for redemption tracking/status.
- Integrate leaderboard and achievement APIs for real-time status display.

Adding these elements will make your reward page a **destination**, not just a checkpoint! This approach builds engagement, shows progression, and creates irresistible loyalty loops matched to your app’s architecture.[1]
